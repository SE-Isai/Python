# Please note:

If you have registered as a 'new user', than you have re-run the program, you won't be able to sign in with the 'new user', because the program is running in the RAM, and every time you run it, it stars as it has started for the first time, so all data that have been saved in lists or dictionaries or tuples or whatever, will be removed, and initialized just like they are written in the code,  so in order to save data during the program run time, you need to save them in external files (and it would be better if they are more structured data formats like JSON that we will see in the next sessions, or databases), and every time you wanna get this data back you need to open those files and get the data that you need from them.
