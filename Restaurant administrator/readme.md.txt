# Restaurant Cost Management System

This is the first version of the Restaurant Cost Management System in Python. Although there are still some basic things, I will be working on more updates to add more features and improve the graphical interface.

## Current Features

- Add and remove products with their respective prices.
- Show the current list of products and their price in a list.
- Show the total costs of the products in the list.

## How to use the System

1. Run the `restaurant_cost_system.py` file.
2. Use the "Add" and "Remove" buttons to add or remove products from the list.
3. New products and changes in prices will be automatically saved to the `productos.txt` file.
4. Use the "Show Total" button to see the total cost of the products in the list.

I hope you enjoy using this system and stay tuned for future updates!``` 

Remember to place the `readme.md` file at the root of the project so it's visible in the GitHub repository.
